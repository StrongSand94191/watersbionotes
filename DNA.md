DNA stores genetic information. It is located in the chromosomes inside the nucleus of a cell. 

# History

The discovery of DNA was published in a journal by **Watson and Crick**, who discovered the structure of DNA as well.

# Structure

- Hydrogen bonds connect **two strands of nucleotides** together to create DNA (**D**eoxy**r**ibo**n**ucleic Acid)
These nucleotide strands form a double helix, which looks like a **twisting ladder** and can be millions of base pairs long.

- The backbone of the ladder is made up of **sugar and phosphate.**

- The rungs of the ladder are made up of **four nitrogenous bases**, usually shortened to **A, C, T, G**. Their full names are:
    
**A**denine
**C**ytosine
**T**hymine
**G**uamine

**When forming bonds:**
- G alaways pairs with C
- A always pairs with T
	
**This is because:**
G and C are held together by 3 hydrogen bonds
A and T are held together by 2 hydrogen bonds


- A and G have 2 rings in their molecular structure, so their bases are called Purines
- C and T have 3 rings, so their bases are called Pyrimidines
**Purine always pairs with pyridimine when forming bonds.**

The monomers of DNA are **nucleotide deoxyribonucleotides**.
