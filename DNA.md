DNA stores genetic information. It is located in the chromosomes inside the nucleus of a cell. 

# History

The discovery of DNA was published in a journal by **Watson and Crick**, who discovered the structure of DNA as well.

# Structure

- Hydrogen bonds connect **two strands of nucleotides** together to create DNA (**D**eoxy**r**ibo**n**ucleic Acid)
These nucleotide strands form a double helix, which looks like a **twisting ladder** and can be millions of base pairs long.

- The backbone of the ladder is made up of **sugar and phosphate.**

- The rungs of the ladder are made up of **four nitrogenous bases**, usually shortened to **A, C, T, G**. Their full names are:
    
**A**denine
**C**ytosine
**T**hymine
**G**uamine

**When forming bonds:**
- G always pairs with C
- A always pairs with T
	
**This is because:**
G and C are held together by 3 hydrogen bonds
A and T are held together by 2 hydrogen bonds


- A and G have 2 rings in their molecular structure, so their bases are called Purines
- C and T have 3 rings, so their bases are called Pyrimidines
**Purine always pairs with pyridimine when forming bonds.**

The monomers of DNA are **nucleotide deoxyribonucleotides**.

DNA: **D**eoxy**r**ibosugar
RNA: **R**ibosugar

Nucleotides are made up of:
Nitrogeneous base (A, C, T, G)
Sugar and Phosphate (part of the ladder)

Since DNA needs to be able to fit into the nucleus:
- First, it wraps itself around proteins called histones.
- Then, the histones wrap around themselves to form chromatin.
- Then, the chromatin winds even tighter to make a chromosome.

Humans have 46 chromosomes, 23 from each parent.

When new cells are made, DNA is split apart by helicase, which disrupts hydrogen bonds, and both strands duplicate themselves to create a second strand of DNA.

Topoisomerase is ahead of the replication fork, and it twists the DNA and snaps it back together.

An RNA primer is behind the replication fork.

DNA Polymerase II connects the phosphate group of each nucleus

1. Point mutations - Changes in one or a few nucleotides; they occur at a single "point"
	
- Substitution: The wrong nucleotide is inserted in the place of the right one
This will only affect one amino acid

Frameshift mutation - Adding (inserting) or deleting a nucleotide; shift the "reading frame" of genetic messages
	
- Insertion: when you insert a nucleotide in addition to what should be there
Ex:
TAT CGC ATG GAA
TAT **G**CG CAT GGA A

This type of mutation will affect **every amino acid after the mutation!**

Chromosomal mutations - changes in the number or structure of chromosomes. These mutations can change:
1. Locations of chenese on chromosomes
2. Number of copies of some genes

**Are all mutations bad?**
No! Many or most mutations are neutral (or have little or no effect on genes) and some are even good or beneficial.

Harmful mutation - CANCER; changes in DNA cause cells to grow uncontrollably

Beneficial mutations - proteins with new or altered activities that help organisms adaptl extra sets of chromosomes in plants can make plants stronger
