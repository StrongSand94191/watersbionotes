#### Eukaryotic Cells:
**Examples:** Plant and animal cells
- Large and complex
- 10 to 100 nanometers in size
- Can be **unicellular or multicellular**
- Has a **nucleus**
- Has **linear DNA**
- Has **paired diploid chromosomes**
- Has **membrane-bound organelles**
- Mostly reproduce sexually
- Cell division by **mitosis**


#### Prokaryotic Cells:
**Examples:** Bacteria and archaea cells
- Small and simple
- 0.1 to 5 nanometers in size
- **Unicellular**
- Has **no nucleus**
- Circular DNA
- Single haploid chromosomes
- Lack membrane-bound organelles
- Reproduce both sexually and asexually
- Cell division by **binary fission**


#### Both Cells:
- Have **cytoplasm**
- Have **ribosomes**
- Have a **cell membrane**
- Have **DNA**


### Cell Transport:
**Diffusion:** The process where molecules move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, **eventually making the solution homogenous**.

**Solution = solute + solvent**, just as **Kool-Aid = sugar + water**

[ ] = A symbol that means "concentration"

**Solute:** The thing that's being dissolved
**Solvent:** What the solute is being dissolved into

**Osmosis:** Diffusion, but with water instead of molecules

###### Passive Transport:
- Doesn't require ATP
- Includes osmosis and diffusion

###### Active Transport:
- When a cell moves materials against the concentration gradient
- Requires ATP

**Kinds of active transport:**
1. Endocytosis: process of taking materials into the cell by means of pockets in the cell membrane (*example – Phagocytosis, Pinocytosis*)
2. **Exocytosis:** when a cell releases large amounts of materials

**Robert Hooke:** English scientist who saw cells by looking at cork under a microscope in the 17th century.

**Anton von Leeuwenhoek:** Dutch Scientist who observed pond water under a microscope and saw tiny living cells

**The cell theory states:**
1. All living things are made up of cells 
2. Cells are the basic units of structure and function in living things 
3. New cells are produced from existing cells

**Cells have specialized structures to carry out functions. These are called organelles.

### Vocab
- **Nucleus:** the “command center” of the cell

- **Mitochondria:** converts food into energy that the cell can use

- **Cell membrane:** Decides which materials move into and out of the cell
The cell membrane allows materials to diffuse into and out of the cell in order to maintain equilibrium. Cell membranes are selectively permeable, meaning they <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">allow some materials to pass in and out</mark>, while not allowing others to pass.

- **Cytoplasm:** The “water” that all of the other organelles float around in

- **Ribosomes:** Make proteins

- **Endoplasmic Reticulum:** 
**Rough ER:** makes proteins. It looks rough because <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">ribosomes are attached to it</mark>.
**Smooth ER:** makes lipids and enzymes

- **Golgi Bodies:** <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">Sort and package proteins</mark> and ships them out of the cell

- **Cytoskeleton:** Supports the cell

- **Lysosomes:** Remove wastes

- **Cell Wall:** Supports and protects plant cells (*only in plant cells*)

- **Chloroplast:** Converts sunlight into energy, makes plants green (*only in plant cells*)

- **Isotonic:** solutions that are the same strength 
- **Hypertonic:** the solution that is more concentrated 
- **Hypotonic:** the solution that is less concentrated.

**What happens to a cell when it is placed in different solutions?**
- Nothing happens in an isotonic solution
- Cells **shrink** in a hypertonic solution
- Cells **swell** in a hypotonic solution

**Cell Specialization:** different cells <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">develop into different things</mark> (*some become skin, some become bone, some become blood cells, and some become organs*)
