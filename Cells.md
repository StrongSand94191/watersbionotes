# Cell Types
## Eukaryotic Cells
**Examples:** Plant and animal cells
- Large and complex
- 10 to 100 nanometers in size
- Can be **unicellular or multicellular**
- Has a **nucleus**
- Has **linear DNA**
- Has **paired diploid chromosomes**
- Has **membrane-bound organelles**
- Mostly reproduce sexually
- Cell division by **mitosis**
## Prokaryotic Cells
**Examples:** Bacteria and archaea cells
- Small and simple
- 0.1 to 5 nanometers in size
- **Unicellular**
- Has **no nucleus**
- Circular DNA
- Single haploid chromosomes
- Lack membrane-bound organelles
- Reproduce both sexually and asexually
- Cell division by **binary fission**

## Both Cells
- Have **cytoplasm**
- Have **ribosomes**
- Have a **cell membrane**
- Have **DNA**

# Cell Transport

**Diffusion:** The process where molecules move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, **eventually making the solution homogeneous**.

**Solute:** The thing that's being dissolved
**Solvent:** What the solute is being dissolved into

**Solution = solute + solvent**, just as **Kool-Aid = sugar + water**

[ ] = A symbol that means "concentration"

**Osmosis:** Diffusion, but with water instead of molecules

## Passive Transport:
- Doesn't require ATP
- When a cell moves materials from ==high concentration to low concentration==
- Goes with the flow of traffic
- Includes osmosis and diffusion

## Active Transport:
- When a cell moves materials from ==low concentration to high concentration==
- Goes against the flow of traffic
- Requires ATP

**Kinds of active transport:
1. **Endocytosis:** process of taking materials into the cell by means of pockets in the cell membrane (*example – Phagocytosis, Pinocytosis*)
2. **Exocytosis:** when a cell releases large amounts of materials

# Vocab

- **Robert Hooke:** English scientist who saw cells by looking at cork under a microscope in the 17th century.

- **Anton von Leeuwenhoek:** Dutch Scientist who observed pond water under a microscope and saw tiny living cells
- **Nucleus:** the “command center” of the cell 

- **Mitochondria:** converts food into energy that the cell can use

- **Cell membrane:** Decides which materials move into and out of the cell
The cell membrane allows materials to diffuse into and out of the cell in order to maintain equilibrium. Cell membranes are selectively permeable, meaning they ==allow some materials to pass in and out==, while not allowing others to pass. Smaller molecules like oxygen pass through the phosphate bilayer easily. 

- **Facilitated diffusion:** The proteins in the cell membrane can act like a tunnel to transport bigger molecules such as sugar. Each protein can only transport one specific molecule. 

- **Cytoplasm:** The “water” that all of the other organelles float around in

- **Ribosomes:** Make proteins

- **Endoplasmic Reticulum:
**Rough ER:** makes proteins. It looks rough because ==ribosomes are attached to it==.
**Smooth ER:** makes lipids and enzymes

- **Golgi Bodies:** ==Sort and package proteins== and ships them out of the cell

- **Cytoskeleton:** Supports the cell

- **Lysosomes:** Remove wastes

- **Cell Wall:** Supports and protects plant cells (*only in plant cells*)

- **Chloroplast:** Converts sunlight into energy, makes plants green (*only in plant cells*)

- **Flagella:** The tail on the end of the cell that helps it move (*only on some cells*)

- **Isotonic:** solutions that are the same strength 
- **Hypertonic:** the solution that is more concentrated 
- **Hypotonic:** the solution that is less concentrated.

**What happens to a cell when it is placed in different solutions?
- Nothing happens in an isotonic solution
- Cells **shrink** in a hypertonic solution
- Cells **swell** in a hypotonic solution

**The cell theory states:
1. All living things are made up of cells 
2. Cells are the basic units of structure and function in living things 
3. New cells are produced from existing cells

**Cell Specialization:** different cells ==develop into different things== (*some become skin, some become bone, some become blood cells, and some become organs*)
