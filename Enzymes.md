# Enzymes
## Chemical Reactions
- A process that ==changes one set of chemicals into another set of chemicals==
- Always involves ==changes in chemical bonds== that join atoms in compounds
    
- **Reactants:** elements or compounds that ==enter into chemical reactions==
- **Products:** elements or compounds ==produced by chemical reactions==

---

## Energy in Reactions
- Energy is released or absorbed ==whenever chemical bonds are made or broken==
- Energy changes are the single most important factor determining ==how easily chemical reactions will occur==

- Chemical reactions that absorb energy will not occur without a source of energy

- **Activation energy:** Energy needed to ==get a reaction going==

- **Enzymes:** Specialized proteins that act as ==biological catalysts==

- **Catalyst:** a substance that speeds up rate of chemical reaction by ==lowering a reaction's activation energy==

- Living cells ==use enzymes== to ==speed up virtually every important chemical reaction== that takes place in cells.

- Enzymes are very specific in what reactions they perform

- The name of enzyme is derived from reaction it catalyzes

- Enzymes are ==not used up== in a chemical reaction.

- **Enzyme action:** Can increase reaction speed

- Reactants are known as substrates

- Substrates ==bind to an enzyme's active site== (*shape of active site fits substrate like “lock and key”*)

- Once the products are made, enzyme continues its process

- Enzymes are ==affected by pH and temperature==

- Cells can regulate activities of enzymes.

- Proteins can turn “on” or “off”
