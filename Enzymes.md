**Chemical Reactions:**
- A process that <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">changes one set of chemicals into another set of chemicals</mark>
- Always involves <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">changes in chemical bonds</mark> that join atoms in compounds
    
- **Reactants:** elements or compounds that <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">enter into chemical reactions</mark>
- **Products:** elements or compounds <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">produced by chemical reactions</mark>


**Energy in Reactions:**
- Energy is released or absorbed <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">whenever chemical bonds are made or broken</mark>
- Energy changes are the single most important factor determining <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">how easily chemical reactions will occur</mark>

- <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">Chemical reactions that absorb energy will not occur without a source of energy</mark>

- **Activation energy:** Energy needed to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">get a reaction going</mark>

- **Enzymes:** Specialized proteins that act as <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">biological catalysts</mark>

- **Catalyst:** a substance that speeds up rate of chemical reaction by <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">lowering a reaction's activation energy</mark>

- Living cells <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">use enzymes</mark> to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">speed up virtually every important chemical reaction</mark> that takes place in cells.

- Enzymes are very specific in what reactions they perform

- The name of enzyme is derived from reaction it catalyzes

- Enzymes are <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">not used up</mark> in a chemical reaction.

- **Enzyme action:** Can increase reaction speed

- Reactants are known as substrates

- Substrates <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">bind to an enzyme's active site</mark> (*shape of active site fits substrate like “lock and key”*)

- Once the products are made, enzyme continues its process

- Enzymes are <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">affected by pH and temperature</mark>

- Cells can regulate activities of enzymes.

- Proteins can turn “on” or “off”
