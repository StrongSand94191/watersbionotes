### Prefixes and Suffixes

-   **POLY-** means MANY or LOTS
    
-   **MONO-** means one, which is the basic subunit of a polymer
    
-   The suffix "**-OSE**", refers to mono sugars like gluc**ose**, fruct**ose**, and sucr**ose
    
-   The suffix "**-SACCHARIDE**" refers to sugar; i.e., a poly**saccharide** is a large molecule composed of many sugar subunits.
    
-   The suffix "**-PEPTIDE**" refers to a molecule composed of 2 or more AMINO ACIDS; a di**peptide** is composed of 2 amino acids


### Biological Molecules

-   All living organisms are made from simple elements found in the earth.
    
-   These elements join together to make molecules
    
-   The four most common elements that make living organisms are:
1. Carbon
2. Hydrogen
3. Oxygen
4. Nitrogen
    
-   All biological molecules are big molecules called **POLYMERS**
    
-   Polymers are made from small molecules called **MONOMERS**


### Four Groups of Biomolecules


###### Carbohydrates
- Also known as: SUGAR!
    
- Made of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen
    
- Monomers are **monosaccharides** (simple sugar)
- Polymers are **polysaccharides** *(for example: starch!)*


**Functions:**
- Store easy to get energy
    
- Define structure
    
- Cellulose is used to give plants their shape
*Humans can’t digest cellulose, which is why a lot of plants look the same coming out as they did going in...gross*


**Examples:**
-   Glucose
-   Cellulose
-   Fructose
-   Sucrose


###### Lipids
- Also known as: Fats, Cholesterol, Hormones
    
- Made of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen
    
Lipids don’t have polymers and monomers. 
They are made of **two parts**: 
- Glycerol
- Fatty Acids


**Functions:**
- **Insulation** (*keeps you warm*)
    
- **Storage** (*Stores more energy than sugar, but it’s harder to get to*)
    
- **Makes up the outer layer of the cell** (*Called the lipid bilayer*)
    
- **Moves messages around your body** (*for example, testosterone)


**Sources:**
- Cake
- Candy
- Waxes
- Oils
- Butter
- Chips


###### Nucleic Acids

- Made of: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus
    
Monomers: Nucleotides (*examples: adenine, glycine, cytocine, guanine*)
Polymers: Nucleic Acids


**Functions:**
- **Store the pattern for each person** (*unless you have an identical twin, no one else on earth has the exact same DNA as you!*)


**Examples:** DNA and RNA (*we’ll learn more about these later*)


###### Proteins
- Made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen
    
- Monomers: Amino Acids (*There are 20 different amino acids!*)
- Polymers: Polypeptides (*made from a chain of amino acids*)


**Functions:**
- **Strength** (*makes up your muscles*)
    
- **Structure** (*holds your cells together*)
    
- **Control & Regulation** (*speeds up or slows down the reactions in your body*)
    
- **Transport** (*hemoglobin carries oxygen around your body*)
    
- **Nutrition** (*helps break up your food*)
    
- **Fight Disease** (*antibodies*)


**Sources:**
- There are lots of things you can get protein from, but the best ones are low fat, like fish.
