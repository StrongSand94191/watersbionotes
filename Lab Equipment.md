**Scoopula** is a brand name of a ==spatula-like scoop utensil== used primarily in experimental laboratories to ==transfer solids==: to a weighing paper for weighing, to a cover slip to measure melting point, or a graduated cylinder, or to a watch glass from a flask or beaker through scraping.

**Beakers** ==hold solids or liquids== that ==will not release gases== when reacted ==or are unlikely to splatter== if stirred or heated.

**Erlenmeyer flasks** ==hold solids or liquids== ==that may release gases== during a reaction ==or that are likely to splatter== if stirred or heated.

Rarely used in first year chemistry, the **Florence Flask** is used for the ==mixing of chemicals==. Its narrow neck prevents splash exposure.

A **graduated cylinder** is used to ==measure volumes of liquids==.

A **test tube holder** is useful for ==holding a test tube which is too hot to handle==.

**Test tube brushes** are used to ==clean test tubes and graduated cylinders==. Forcing a large brush into a small test tube will often break the tube.

**Test tube racks** are for ==holding and organizing test tubes== on the laboratory counter. Plastic racks may melt in contact with very hot test tubes.

**Rubber stoppers** are used to ==close containers== to ==avoid spillage== or contamination. Containers should never be heated when there is a stopper in place.

A **watch glass** is used to ==hold a small amount of solid==, such as the product of a reaction.

A **glass rod** is used to ==manually stir solutions==. It can also be used to transfer a single drop of a solution.

**Red litmus paper** is used to identify ==bases==.
**Blue litmus paper** is used to identify ==acids==.

**Forceps** (or tweezers) are used to ==pick up small objects==.

A **funnel** is used to aid in the ==transfer of liquid== from one vessel to another.

A **Mohr pipet** ==measures and delivers== exact volumes of ==liquids==.

**Weighing boats** are used to ==weigh solids== that will be transferred to another vessel.

**Spatulas** are used to ==dispense solid chemicals== from their containers. 
Chemicals should never be transferred with your bare hands.

**Beaker tongs** are used to ==move beakers== containing hot liquids.

**Bunsen burners** are used for the ==heating of nonvolatile liquids and solids==.

The **evaporating dish** is used for the ==heating of stable solid compounds and elements==.

The **clay triangle** is used as a ==support for porcelain crucibles== when being ==heated over a Bunsen burner==.

**Ringstands** are a safe and convenient way to ==perform reactions== that require heating ==using a Bunsen burner==.

**Iron rings** ==connect to a ringstand== and ==provide a stable, elevated platform== for the reaction.

**Utility clamps** are used to ==secure test tubes, distillation columns, and burets to the ringstand==.

**Wire gauze** ==sits on the iron ring== to ==provide a place to stand a beaker==. 
On older wire gauze, the white material is asbestos!

**Strikers** are used to ==light Bunsen burners==. The flints on strikers are expensive. Do not operate the striker repeatedly just to see the sparks!
