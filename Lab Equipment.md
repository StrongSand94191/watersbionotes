### Lab Equipment

**Scoopula** is a brand name of a <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">spatula-like scoop utensil</mark> used primarily in experimental laboratories to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">transfer solids</mark>: to a weighing paper for weighing, to a cover slip to measure melting point, or a graduated cylinder, or to a watch glass from a flask or beaker through scraping.

**Beakers** <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">hold solids or liquids</mark> that <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">will not release gases</mark> when reacted <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">or are unlikely to splatter</mark> if stirred or heated.

**Erlenmeyer flasks** <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">hold solids or liquids</mark> <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">that may release gases</mark> during a reaction <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">or that are likely to splatter</mark> if stirred or heated.

Rarely used in first year chemistry, the **Florence Flask** is used for the <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">mixing of chemicals</mark>. Its narrow neck prevents splash exposure.

A **graduated cylinder** is used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">measure volumes of liquids</mark>.

A **test tube holder** is useful for <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">holding a test tube which is too hot to handle</mark>.

**Test tube brushes** are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">clean test tubes and graduated cylinders</mark>. Forcing a large brush into a small test tube will often break the tube.

**Test tube racks** are for <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">holding and organizing test tubes</mark> on the laboratory counter. Plastic racks may melt in contact with very hot test tubes.

**Rubber stoppers** are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">close containers</mark> to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">avoid spillage</mark> or contamination. Containers should never be heated when there is a stopper in place.

A **watch glass** is used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">hold a small amount of solid</mark>, such as the product of a reaction.

A **glass rod** is used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">manually stir solutions</mark>. It can also be used to transfer a single drop of a solution.

**Red litmus paper** is used to identify <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">bases</mark>.
**Blue litmus paper** is used to identify <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">acids</mark>.

**Forceps** (or tweezers) are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">pick up small objects</mark>.

A **funnel** is used to aid in the <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">transfer of liquid</mark> from one vessel to another.

A **Mohr pipet** <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">measures and delivers</mark> exact volumes of <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">liquids</mark>.

**Weighing boats** are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">weigh solids</mark> that will be transferred to another vessel.

**Spatulas** are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">dispense solid chemicals</mark> from their containers. 
Chemicals should never be transferred with your bare hands.

**Beaker tongs** are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">move beakers</mark> containing hot liquids.

**Bunsen burners** are used for the <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">heating of nonvolatile liquids and solids</mark>.

The **evaporating dish** is used for the <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">heating of stable solid compounds and elements</mark>.

The **clay triangle** is used as a <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">support for porcelain crucibles</mark> when being <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">heated over a Bunsen burner</mark>.

**Ringstands** are a safe and convenient way to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">perform reactions</mark> that require heating <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">using a Bunsen burner</mark>.

**Iron rings** <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">connect to a ringstand</mark> and <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">provide a stable, elevated platform</mark> for the reaction.

**Utility clamps** are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">secure test tubes, distillation columns, and burets to the ringstand.</mark>

**Wire gauze** <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">sits on the iron ring</mark> to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">provide a place to stand a beaker</mark>. 
On older wire gauze, the white material is asbestos!

**Strikers** are used to <mark style="background: #6a6e00;">light Bunsen burners</mark>. The flints on strikers are expensive. Do not operate the striker repeatedly just to see the sparks!
