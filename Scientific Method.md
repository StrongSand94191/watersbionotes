# Steps in the Scientific Method

## 1. Observation
- Gathered through your senses 
    
- A scientist notices something in their natural world

- An example of an observation might be noticing that many salamanders near a pond have curved, not straight, tails


## 2. Hypothesis
- A suggested solution to the problem.
    
- Must be testable
    
- Sometimes written as If... Then... Statements
    
- Predicts an outcome 
    
- An example of a hypothesis might be that the salamanders have curved tails due to a pollutant in the moist soil where they live.


## 3. Experiment
- A procedure to test the hypothesis.
    
- Variable - factor in the experiment that is being tested
    
- A good or valid" experiment will only have ONE variable!


## 4. Data Collection
- Results of the experiment 
    
- May be quantitative (numbers) or qualitative
    
- Must be organized into charts, tables, or graphs


## 5. Conclusion
- The answer to the hypothesis based on the data obtained from the experiment


## 6. Retest
- In order to verify the results, experiments must be retested.
    
- It is best to make several trials with each independent variable.

# Controls & Variables

- The experimenter makes a special effort to keep other factors constant so that they will not effect the outcome. Those factors are called **control variables**.
    
- Controls are **NOT tested**, they're used for comparison.


- The factor that is changed is known as the **independent variable**.
    
- The factor that is measured or observed is called the **dependent variable**.

# Example of Controls & Variables

Suppose you want to figure out the fastest route to walk home from school. You will try several different routes and time how long it takes you to get home by each one. Since you are only interested in finding a route that is fastest for you, you will do the walking yourself.

- Varying the route is the **independent variable**
    
- The time it takes is the **dependent variable**
    
- Keeping the same walker throughout makes the walker a **control variable**
